# Helios Form Editor

This extension provides a JSON form editor (based on the [JSON Editor](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor)) library. You can use this extension with 'Object' field types.

The extension generates a form based on a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) defined in [schema.json.js](./src/schema.json.js). The generated form allows you to create JSON objects that are valid against that schema.
